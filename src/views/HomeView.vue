    <h1>Welcome to Hire a Grandkid Tech Support!</h1>
    <p>
     Hi there! My name is Eli and I'm a local high school student. I'm involved in backstage at school, study digital solutions, and help out 
     with tech at local organisations. Hire a Grandkid is a business I started with the aim of helping older members of the 4074 community with 
     both setting up new devices, and also teaching them how to use their existing devices. While I'm not a professional, I do have a good 
     generic understanding of technology, and I'm more than happy to help, charging only a fraction of what a professional would.
